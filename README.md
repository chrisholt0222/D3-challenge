## Background

Project statement: Develop an interactive chart using D3 that displays US health risks. 

The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on demographic information and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collects health risk factors. From the Census and BRFSS, the following 2014 demographic data (poverty percentage, age, and medium income) and the following 2014 health risk factors (percent without healthcare, percent obese, and percent smokes) where selected by state. The selected information was analyzed to produce the following interactive chart and analysis (https://chrisholt0222.github.io/D3-challenge/). The demographic data is mapped to the horizontal axis and the healthcare risk factors are mapped to the vertical axis. The bolded label is the active label.

The data set used is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml).
